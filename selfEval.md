# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
-It took me a little bit to figure out how to get the only the second value to print in the one exercise, but I knew if I played around with it I would figure it out.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
-I continue to take notes, and I do find it helpful. One thing I need to get in the habit of doing is taking notes on my initial read-through of a section. What I usually do is take vague notes that lead to me continuing to go back to the lesson and take more, so I should get more in depth the first read through.
Im taking my most helpful notes when I go back to pick up on things that I initially missed.

- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
-I have definitely leaned into trying to figure it out with trial and error, but will Google if I just cant figure it out. Coding is quite logical so I know there is usually a very good and sometimes simple explanation for what I am missing.
